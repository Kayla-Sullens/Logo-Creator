# Logo-Creator

## Description
This project was created using Node, in order to generate an SVG logo based on user input. Users are asked to enter up to 3 characters, select a text color, select a shape from a list, and then select a shape color. Then a logo is created. I have a walkthrough video below to show the functionality, as well as the passing tests.
